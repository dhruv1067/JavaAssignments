Ans 1 : Conditional operators in Java, also known as relational or comparison operators, are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. The result of these comparisons is a Boolean value ('true' or 'false'). Conditional operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program, such as in 'if' statements, 'loops', and ternary operations.

Ans 2 : Unary operator, binary operator, Ternary operator.

Ans 3 : The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks for execution.

Ans 4 : There are two priority levels -> High priority */%  and Low priority +-

Ans 5 : 1> if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specialized condition is true
        2> else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
        3> else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
        4> switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to executed

Ans 6 : if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true
}

Ans 7 : for loop, while loop, do-while loop.

Ans 8 : For loop -> executed once the condition is checked, entry controlled loop
        Do-while loop -> condition is checked after the statement is executed , exit controlled loop.

Ans 8 : public class Numbers
        {
            public static void main(String[] args)
            {
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	    }
	}
